This project was an assignment in highschool. I made a database that had the functionality of matching
volunteers who are able to do specific jobs, with jobs that had numbers of availabilities.
The actual executable file is in the directory called "IA with console"; it has instructions on how to run
the program. The documentation for the project as my Internal Assessment in Higher Level computer science
per the IB diploma is in the directory "ICS IA documents". 

Do enjoy!

P.S. Do watch the video in "ICS IA documents/ video.txt" for a demo of my program.
